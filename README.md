## ðŸŽ¶ Simple Music Player ðŸŽ¶
Hey there! This is a super basic music player project I made. Itâ€™s not much, but it does the main thing â€“ plays music! Just a straightforward design with some functionality to browse and play songs.

## Built with
HTML,CSS,JS.

## Features
Play / Pause Button: Toggle between playing and pausing the current track.
Seekbar: Move the seekbar to skip to different parts of a song.
Track Info: Displays song and artist name while playing.
Automatic Track Fetch: Grabs songs directly from the music folder.

## Getting Started
Download / Clone the Repo: Get the files on your local machine.
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nomad-soul00/Music-Player.git

Add Songs: Drop your .mp3 files in the music folder.
Run the Project: Open index.html in your browser to try it out.

<h2><span style="color:green">Note: This only works on a local setup because of CORS policies on live servers, so you might need to run it with something like Live Server on VS Code.</span><h2>

## How It Works
Just click on a song to play it! You can use the buttons for play/pause, and the seekbar to move through the track. Simple as that. ðŸ˜Š

## To-Do / Future Plans
 Add more visual polish
 Improve playlist management
 Add volume and playback speed controls
